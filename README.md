# BU Meetup Project:
## Project Description:
To match students across BU's different programs and to promote more interaction in the student body in an organized but low-stakes setting. We are seeking to develop a simple interface that invites students to opt in for semi-regular matchmaking while maximizing connections between new students across programs.

## Problem to be Solved:
The goal is to roll out a bare bones version of this project for the Fall of 2022. Ideally, the skeleton for this project would allow for future additions such as variable group size or matching based on compatibility of interests. But the immediate goal is to develop a proof-of-concept and see how the students engage with the program.
